## Course Description

In an age of ever-accelerating change, perhaps our greatest asset is our curiosity... a desire and self-guided ability to learn. Do you learn best through practice?

In E-Commerce Tech, you will apply emerging technologies to human needs right now. We begin by exploring a breadth of opportunities to build a shared context of what we might explore together. By the end of week three, you will choose a focus area and join a team to dive deeper by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), or Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) with modern app development practices.

In order to participate in this course, you need a laptop, and you must bring your laptop to each class/lab.


## Topical Outline

-   Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    -   Generative AI: Chat & Diffusion
    -   Composite AI / Multiagent Systems: personalize and act on user input
    -   Machine Learning (ML): recommender systems
    -   Conversational UIs (CUI / Bots): trust, and transparency to drive sales
-   Product Development
    -   Planning & Design
    -   Principles, Patterns, & Practices
    -   Third-Party Integration: trading CAPEX, for OPEX
    -   APIs / server frameworks
    -   Multi-Page Applications (Web MPAs)

-   Leverage ML algorithms that reveal frequent patterns in user behavior and make recommendations based on those patterns
-   Compare algorithms for finding frequent patterns in user behavior
-   Validate or falsify hypothesis through technical proofs of concept
-   Convert speech, or text to intent, entities, and actions
-   Contribute to a server-side web application framework to deliver new features
-   Contribute to a client-side web Multi-Page Application (MPA) to deliver new features

## Prerequisites

Proficiency with at least one modern programming language (i.e. JavaScript / Python / Go / C# / Java) and modern programming concepts.

## Grading Rubric
| Percent | Component |
|:--------|:----------|
| 30% | Exam |
| 50% | [Project](Project.md) |
| 20% | Participation & Discussions |

_Letter grade evaluation is described below. Final grades may be adjusted up or down based on the instructor's holistic assessment of each student's demonstrated performance and learning._

| Percent | Letter | Grade Performance Level |
|:--------|:-------|:------------------------|
| 99.0-100% | A+ | Reserved for truly exceptional performance |
| 94.0-98.9% | A | Outstanding performance and quality of work along all dimensions, going beyond expectations, deliverables of highest professional quality |
| 91.0-93.9% | A- | Excellent performance and quality of work along all dimensions, meets all expectations (but doesn't go beyond), deliverables of professional quality |
| 88.0-90.9% | B+ | Good to very good performance and quality of work along most dimensions, meets expectations, but deliverables may be missing a required component |
| 84.0-87.9% | B | Good overall performance and quality of work along most dimensions, meets expectations, but deliverables may be missing a few required components |
| 81.0-83.9% | B- | Performance and quality of work below expectations along many dimensions, although deliverables may have all equired components |
| 78.0-80.9% | C+ | Performance and quality of work below expectations along many dimensions, and deliverables may be missing a few required components |
| 74.0-77.9% | C | Performance and quality of work below expectations along most dimensions, and deliverables are missing many components |
| 71.0-73.9% | C- | Work represents minimum effort (student fails the course) |

## Course Policies and expectations
In order to participate in this course, you need a laptop, and you must bring your laptop to each class/recitation/lab.

The participation grade will include some in-class discussions. Make sure I know ahead of time if you are not able to attend class.

I expect you to establish a professional relationship with each other, and with me. That means clear communication, and at times, negotiation. In the marketplace, communications skills are among the most desirable qualities that hiring managers look for. Take the opportunity to practice the following skills:

* **Listen** and communicate your comprehension.
* **Question** and attempt to reduce ambiguity. Be honest and open about what you don’t understand.
* **Criticize** and argue _respectfully_, and _constructively_.
* **Venture** and be resourceful. Back your statements with fact and research based evidence.
* **Calculate** and be diplomatic: disagree respectfully; think about what you are saying; be concise and try not to waste other’s time.

## Cheating and Plagiarism

Plagiarism and other forms of academic misrepresentation are taken extremely seriously. Misrepresentation of another’s work as one’s own is widely recognized as among the most serious violations. The violation is clearly flagrant when it occurs as plagiarism on a required paper or assignment or as cheating on an examination, regardless of whether it is a take-home or in-class examination. The punishment for such offenses can involve expulsion from the program. There are many other ways in which a violation can occur.

Academic Dishonesty: Students are expected to maintain the highest ethical standards inside and outside the classroom. Cheating on exams and term papers (i.e. plagiarism and unauthorized collaboration) is obviously discouraged and will be treated appropriately. The usual penalty for violations is a failing grade for the particular assignment in question; however, in some instances, such actions may result in a failing grade for the course.

This course defines cheating as the verbal, written, printed or digital communication of code for the purpose of completing a graded component (assignment, exam or project). Should an instance of cheating be discovered, all involved parties, be they provider or recipient, will receive no points for the component in question. Should a second instance of cheating occur, the student(s) in question will receive a failing grade for the course. ALL instances of cheating will be reported to the appropriate Associate Dean.

It is common in the software industry to share code. The open-source community is built on just that. Our own code will be hosted as open-source in Github, so we can see each other's work. While sharing is good and fine, we must remember to cite our resources. In this course, all borrowed code must be preceded with a comment that cites the author and the url source. Failure to do so will result in docked points. Failure to cite code that is borrowed from another student in this course counts as cheating. Also, be mindful not to borrow too much, as it will also negatively impact your grade.

Leveraging another's code as inspiration for your own does not always require citing. For this course, you do not need to cite a source if you changed more than 30% of the code.

## Can I use Generative AI, such as Chat GPT, in this Course?

### In Limited Cases, Yes

Within this class, there are situations and contexts where you will be required to use AI programs such as ChatGPT, DALL-E and others. Outside of these specific guided activities, you will not be permitted to use AI tools for any reason.

### Learning Generative AI Is an Important Skill, you may use it to:

-   Brainstorm new ideas
-   Improve your grammar
-   Improve the quality of your work by generating suggestions, such as comments and tests
-   As part of your course project deliverables (e.g. integration with Generative AI)

### You may NOT use Generate AI:

-   To generate your responses to graded discussions
-   On the Final Exam

### Academic Integrity Violation

Using ChatGPT or other generative AI outside of these specific guided activities or to generate any other course content will be considered an academic integrity violation.

### Ask before using AI

If you are uncertain about whether or not you are allowed to use AI, ASK FIRST.

If you are uncertain about whether or not a particular technique of using AI is allowed, ASK FIRST.
