Online discussions provide a place to contemplate what we are learning in a public forum. Think of them as virtual hallways, where we can discuss topics, refine our knowledge and help each other gain a more comprehensive understanding of these topics.

In the marketplace, communications skills are among the most desirable assets that hiring managers look for. Take the opportunity to practice the following skills:

* **Listen** and communicate your comprehension.
* **Question** and attempt to reduce ambiguity. Be honest and open about what you don’t understand.
* **Criticize** and argue _constructively_.
* **Venture** and be resourceful. Back your statements with fact and research based evidence.
* **Calculate** and be diplomatic: disagree respectfully; think about what you are saying; be concise and try not to waste other’s time.

Your participation in discussions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
